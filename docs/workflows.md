# CAO Workflows

A **workflow** is a saved, multi-step agent pipeline you author once and run on demand.
It drives one or more agent *steps* — fan work out across agents, collect their
results, and resume a run that was interrupted from a durable journal.

There are two authoring tiers:

- **Python script tier** (recommended, full power) — a `.py` program that drives agent
  steps through the `cao_workflow` shim. This is the **primary authoring path**: it
  supports real branching, concurrent fan-out, per-iteration Python over agent output,
  and parameterized inputs. The [`cao-workflow` skill](../skills/cao-workflow/SKILL.md)
  teaches it. (The old declarative `workflow-author` YAML skill is **retired**.)
- **YAML tier** (simpler, more limited) — a declarative spec for a fixed sequence. It is
  easier to author and lint. `parallel` and `pipeline` modes are executable: declare
  `needs:` on a step and the engine schedules it only after those steps settle, running
  ready steps concurrently (one agent terminal each). `loop` mode remains reserved. The
  script tier still offers the most control (branching, per-iteration Python over agent
  output); reach for the YAML tier for a straightforward fixed or parallel DAG.

When in doubt, write a script.

For the shim-contract deep-dive (`run_step`/`emit_output`, retry/determinism, the
`reuse_terminal_id` trap), see
[docs/workflow-scripts-authoring-guide.md](workflow-scripts-authoring-guide.md).

## Quick start

Write a small script to the workflows directory, validate it, and run it.

```python
# ~/.aws/cli-agent-orchestrator/workflows/hello.py
from cao_workflow import run_step, emit_output

# Step 1 — a developer writes a note.
note = run_step("claude_code", "developer", "Write a one-line hello note. Return it only.")

# Step 2 — a reviewer critiques it (read-only role: it READS and RETURNS).
review = run_step("claude_code", "reviewer", f"Critique this note in one line: {note.output}")

emit_output({"note": note.output, "review": review.output})
```

```bash
# validate is mandatory — fix every finding before running
cao workflow validate ~/.aws/cli-agent-orchestrator/workflows/hello.py

# run it by its stem, with a pre-announced run-id
cao workflow run hello --run-id hello-1
```

The workflow is run **by its stem** (`hello`), so the filename must be a bare name with
no path separators, and you must not create a same-stem `hello.yaml` sibling — it would
collide on the run surface.

## The lifecycle

Every workflow follows the same path. No step is optional.

1. **Author** — write the `.py` file to `~/.aws/cli-agent-orchestrator/workflows/<name>.py`.
2. **Validate (mandatory gate)** — `cao workflow validate <path>`. Findings are
   **load-bearing**, not style nits:
   - **`import cli_agent_orchestrator` is banned.** The script runs in a separate
     subprocess and must reach CAO only over HTTP through the `cao_workflow` shim.
     Importing the server package breaks that boundary and fails validation.
   - **`random` / `time` / `datetime` / `uuid` warnings.** Resume **re-executes the
     script top-to-bottom** and replays journaled step results. Any nondeterministic
     value at module top level differs on replay and raises `ReplayDivergenceError`.
     Derive IDs from inputs, not from the clock or an RNG. (See the authoring guide for
     why there is no retry.)
3. **Run** — with an explicit, pre-announced `--run-id` so it can be cancelled.
   **Workflows are NEVER auto-run by an agent.** The user approves each run.
4. **Status / cancel / resume** — `cao workflow status <run-id>`,
   `cao workflow cancel <run-id>`, `cao workflow resume <run-id>`.

A validate that reports `valid` (status `pass` or `pass_reserved`) exits 0; a failing
spec exits 1 and lists each error.

## Parameterized workflows (inputs)

Instead of editing a constant per run, declare inputs once and pass values at invocation
time — this is what makes a workflow reusable as a **tool**: author once, invoke with
different inputs.

A workflow declares a **module-level `INPUTS` dict** and reads the resolved values at
runtime with `get_inputs()`:

```python
# ~/.aws/cli-agent-orchestrator/workflows/summarize.py
from cao_workflow import run_step, emit_output, get_inputs

INPUTS = {
    "target_file": {"type": "path", "required": True},
    "max_points":  {"type": "int",  "required": False, "default": 3},
    "verbose":     {"type": "bool", "required": False, "default": False},
}

inputs = get_inputs()                      # {} when nothing was declared; never raises
target_file = inputs["target_file"]        # canonicalized absolute path
max_points = inputs.get("max_points", 3)

review = run_step(
    "claude_code", "reviewer",
    f"Summarize {target_file} in {max_points} bullet points. Return the summary only.",
)
emit_output({"summary": review.output})
```

Run it with `--input key=value` (repeatable):

```bash
cao workflow validate ~/.aws/cli-agent-orchestrator/workflows/summarize.py
cao workflow run summarize --run-id sum-1 \
  --input target_file=/abs/path/to/report.md \
  --input max_points=5 \
  --input verbose=true
```

Each `INPUTS` entry declares a `type` (`string` | `int` | `bool` | `path`), whether it
is `required`, and an optional `default`. At run start, before any step or terminal is
created, values are **validated against the declaration** — an undeclared key, a
wrong-typed value, or a missing required input is a clear error (400) and nothing runs.
`path`-typed inputs are canonicalized through CAO's shared path validator (realpath +
blocked-dir rejection). The resolved map is **capped at 32 KiB** and is **journaled and
replayed verbatim on resume**, so a resumed run sees byte-identical inputs (deterministic).

The CLI coerces `--input` values ergonomically — `true`/`false` → bool, a bare integer →
int, everything else stays a string — but the engine still validates the coerced value
against the declared type, so a mismatch surfaces as an error rather than running with
the wrong value.

## Running: submit-and-follow, detach, or block

`cao workflow run` **submits the run asynchronously and then follows it** — it prints the
run id as soon as the run is durably recorded, then polls until the run reaches a terminal
state, exiting 0 on `completed` and 1 on `failed`/`cancelled`. Because the id is printed
before the run finishes, the run is addressable (`status`, `wait`, `result`, `cancel`) for
its whole life.

Three shapes:

| Invocation | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `cao workflow run <name>` | Submit, print the id, follow to terminal. **Ctrl-C detaches** — it never cancels; the run keeps going server-side. |
| `cao workflow run <name> --detach` | Submit, print the id, exit 0 immediately without following. |
| `cao workflow run <name> --wait` | The retained fully-blocking path: hold the socket until the run finishes. |

> **Breaking change (issue #505) — `--json` output shape.** `run --json` previously echoed
> the complete `WorkflowRunResult` (`run_id`, `workflow_name`, `state`, `steps[]`,
> timestamps, `kind`). Because the default path now *follows* rather than blocks, it emits
> only the stable terminal object:
>
> ```json
> { "run_id": "hello-1", "state": "completed" }
> ```
>
> A non-TTY plain `run` (no `--json`) also emits this JSON, so a piped invocation has one
> stable machine format. **Scripts that read `steps[]` or `workflow_name` off `run --json`
> must change**: fetch the full result explicitly with `cao workflow result <id> --json`
> (or `cao workflow status <id> --json` for a mid-run snapshot). Exit codes are unchanged
> and identical across TTY, non-TTY, and `--json`.
>
> **`--wait --json` is the exception**: it still emits the complete `WorkflowRunResult`.
> `--wait` is the retained fully-blocking path, so returning everything in one call is the
> reason to reach for it. Only the default follow path and `--detach` emit the narrow
> `{run_id, state}` object.

So there are two machine shapes, chosen by invocation:

| Invocation | `--json` shape |
| --- | --- |
| `cao workflow run <name>` (default follow) | `{run_id, state}` |
| `cao workflow run <name> --detach` | the 202 body — `{run_id, state, links}` |
| `cao workflow run <name> --wait` | the full `WorkflowRunResult` |
| `cao workflow result <id>` | the full `WorkflowRunResult` |
| `cao workflow status <id>` | a mid-run snapshot |

Note that no run-level `output` field is returned by `result`, `status`, or the
`workflow_result` / `workflow_wait` MCP tools: run-level output is not journaled, so it is
only available from the blocking `run --wait` path. Per-step outputs are always present on
`steps[].output`.

Choose the shape by how the run is triggered, because the client-side ceilings differ:

- **`cao workflow run` (CLI)** follows by polling, so no single request has to survive the
  whole run. `--wait` uses a client socket timeout of **~8820s (~2.45h)**.
- **`workflow_run` MCP tool (from inside an agent session)** blocks, and is bounded by the
  **MCP host's own per-tool-call timeout** — a host-dependent limit (tens of seconds to a
  few minutes) that can **drop a long blocking call and lose its return value even though
  the server run keeps going**. For a long run from an agent, prefer submit + poll:
  `workflow_run` with a pre-announced id, then `workflow_status` / `workflow_wait`.

Always **pre-announce the run-id** before starting, so you (or the user) can
`cao workflow status <id>` and `cao workflow cancel <id>`.

## Fan-out (concurrency)

To run steps concurrently, use a `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` and give
**every concurrent `run_step` an explicit, stable `step_id`**:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
from cao_workflow import run_step, emit_output, ShimError

def summarize(name):
    try:
        h = run_step("claude_code", "reviewer",
                     f"Summarize {name}. Return the summary only.",
                     step_id=f"summarize:{name}")   # STABLE, explicit step_id (required)
        return name, h.output
    except ShimError as exc:                          # per-unit tolerance
        return name, f"ERROR: {exc}"

items = sorted(some_items)                            # sorted() → stable item→step_id map
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=2) as pool:       # 2 is a good default for claude_code
    results = dict(pool.map(summarize, items))
emit_output(results)
```

Why these rules:

- **Explicit `step_id` is required for fan-out.** The default `call-N` counter is
  race-*free* but **not deterministic across runs** under concurrent scheduling — thread
  timing decides which call claims which `call-N`, so a resume would replay the wrong
  results and raise `ReplayDivergenceError`. `validate` warns when it sees executor use
  without a `step_id`; treat the warning as load-bearing.
- **`sorted()` your inputs** so the item→`step_id` mapping is stable across runs.
- **`max_workers=2` is a sensible default for `claude_code`** (measured: higher values
  starved the heaviest step). Tune it — expose it as an input — when steps are light.

See [`docs/examples/fanout_example.py`](examples/fanout_example.py) for the pattern
end-to-end.

## YAML parallel DAGs (`mode: parallel` / `mode: pipeline`)

The YAML tier can also fan out: set `mode: parallel` and declare `needs:` edges. The
engine runs every step whose `needs` have all settled **concurrently** (each step gets
its own agent terminal), then the next wave, and so on:

```yaml
name: review_parallel
mode: parallel
steps:
  - id: plan
    provider: claude_code
    agent: developer
    prompt: Write a one-line implementation plan.
  - id: implement
    provider: claude_code
    agent: developer
    prompt: "Implement this plan: {{steps.plan.output.answer}}"
    needs: [plan]
  - id: audit
    provider: claude_code
    agent: reviewer
    prompt: "Review this code: {{steps.implement.output.answer}}"
    needs: [implement]
```

- `needs: [a, b]` means *start only after `a` and `b` have settled* — use it to express
  fan-in (a step that consumes several upstream results). A step with no `needs` starts
  in the first wave.
- `mode: pipeline` is a linear chain — declare each step with `needs: [previous]` and
  the engine runs one wave per step (outputs still pipe through
  `{{steps.<id>.output.<field>}}`).
- Unknown / self / cyclic `needs` references fail `cao workflow validate` (they are
  grammar errors, never a silent sequential run).
- Failure semantics match sequential mode: `on_failure: halt` (default) stops
  scheduling new waves and marks the remaining steps skipped; `on_failure: continue`
  keeps the run going. Each step keeps its own `retries:` budget.

The script tier remains the more powerful path (branching, per-iteration Python);
use YAML parallel mode for a fixed, declarative DAG.

## Operational tips

- **Secrets are references, never literal inputs.** Inputs are journaled in plaintext and
  replayed on resume. Pass a *name* (env-var name, secret id) and resolve the actual
  secret inside the step, not as a `--input`.
- **Match the step to the agent's capability.** A **read-only role** (e.g. `reviewer`)
  told to *write* a file will hang the full step budget waiting on a permission it can't
  get. Read-only steps must READ their inputs and RETURN findings inline. Only
  write-capable roles (e.g. `developer`) should be told to write files.
- **Write big outputs to files, return the path.** Don't return megabytes inline — have
  the step write to disk and return the path.
- **Prefer a headless provider (`claude_code`).** `kiro_cli` currently hangs on an
  interactive prompt from a workflow step (a fix is planned); until it lands, use a
  headless provider.

## Resume

`cao workflow resume <run-id>` re-drives an interrupted run: it replays already-completed
steps from the durable journal and re-runs only the rest. Your script never checks "am I
resuming?" — it re-executes from the top, and the server transparently returns journaled
results for calls that already completed. A **deterministic** script (see Validate)
resumes cleanly with no code change; a nondeterministic one surfaces
`ReplayDivergenceError`.

## CLI reference

All twelve verbs live under `cao workflow`.

| Verb | Flags | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `validate <file>` | `--json` | Validate a spec file without running it. Exit 0 valid, 1 invalid. |
| `list` | `--dir <path>`, `--json` | List indexed workflows (rebuilt from spec files on disk). Script-tier rows show `-` for step count. |
| `get <name>` | `--json` | Show the parsed/validated spec for a name or file path. |
| `delete <name>` | `--yes` / `-y` | Delete a workflow's spec file and index row (prompts unless `--yes`). |
| `run <name_or_path>` | `--input k=v` (repeatable), `--run-id <id>`, `--detach`, `--wait`, `--json` | Submit a run and follow it to a terminal state. `--detach` submits and exits; `--wait` blocks inline. Exit 0 completed, 1 failed/cancelled. `--json` emits `{run_id, state}` — see the breaking-change note above. |
| `status <run_id>` | `--json` | Point-in-time status snapshot for a run (full detail, including steps). |
| `runs` | `--state <state>`, `--limit <n>`, `--json` | List recorded runs from the durable journal, newest first. |
| `wait <run_id>` | `--json` | Follow an already-submitted run by polling until terminal. Same exit codes as `run`. |
| `result <run_id>` | `--json` | The complete `WorkflowRunResult` for a run — the full-detail surface `run --json` no longer prints. Answers for an **in-flight** run too (the steps settled so far), not only a finished one, and works for a detached or post-restart run because it is assembled from the journal. |
| `events <run_id>` | `--follow/--no-follow`, `--after-seq <n>`, `--json` | Stream live per-run ordered progress (SSE). `--no-follow` does a one-shot batch read. Requires the events route from issue #504 — on a build without it, both modes report that the stream is unavailable and point at `wait`/`status`, rather than claiming the run is unknown. |
| `resume <run_id>` | `--json` | Resume a crashed/failed run from its journal (blocks). |
| `cancel <run_id>` | — | Cooperatively cancel a running workflow. |

## MCP tool reference (from inside an agent session)

Ten workflow tools are exposed over MCP. Each returns a structured `{ok, ...}` envelope on
every path and never raises into the agent loop.

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `workflow_run` | Run a workflow to completion **inline** (blocking). Bounded by the MCP host's per-tool-call timeout — see the ceiling note above. |
| `workflow_start` | Submit a run **asynchronously**; returns the run id immediately without waiting. |
| `workflow_status` | Point-in-time status snapshot for one run. |
| `workflow_wait` | Poll a submitted run to a terminal state, then return `{ok, run_id, state, kind, steps}`. |
| `workflow_result` | The complete retained result for a run; answerable for a detached or post-restart run. |
| `workflow_list` | List recorded **runs** from the durable journal (not specs). |
| `workflow_events` | Read live per-run ordered progress. Needs the events route from issue #504. |
| `workflow_resume` | Resume a crashed/failed run from its journal. |
| `workflow_cancel` | Cooperatively cancel a running workflow. |
| `workflow_return` | Called by a worker to hand its structured step output back to the run. |

### CLI ↔ MCP name mapping

The two surfaces grew separately and their names do **not** line up. Read this table
before assuming a verb and a tool with similar names do the same thing:

| Concept | CLI verb | MCP tool |
| --- | --- | --- |
| List workflow **specs** | `list` | *(none — MCP has no spec-listing tool)* |
| List workflow **runs** | `runs` | `workflow_list` |
| Submit asynchronously | `run` (the default) | `workflow_start` |
| Run inline / blocking | `run --wait` | `workflow_run` |

> **`list` and `workflow_list` are false friends.** The CLI's `list` lists **specs**; the
> MCP `workflow_list` lists **runs**. An agent reaching for "the list tool" expecting specs
> gets runs. The CLI equivalent of `workflow_list` is `cao workflow runs`.
>
> `run` and `workflow_run` are also not equivalent: the CLI's bare `run` submits
> asynchronously and follows, whereas the MCP `workflow_run` blocks inline. The MCP
> counterpart of the CLI default is `workflow_start`.
